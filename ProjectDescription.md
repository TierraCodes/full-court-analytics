<h1>Project Description</h1>

<h2>Summary</h2>
This project adds a searchable, filterable database of college basketball program staff to the Full 
Court Analytics platform. 

Players will be able to quickly search for a school, expand a dropdown to view coaches and 
staff, and click into a school profile for richer program details and contact information. The 
experience is designed for recruiting and relationship management — allowing users to 
favorite schools, log when they’ve reached out, and track a school’s level of interest. 

The goal is to centralize recruiting research and outreach in one place so players don’t have to 
juggle spreadsheets, scattered notes, and random online directories. Accurate search, fast 
filtering (division, location, conference, etc.), and easy note-taking will help athletes stay 
organized and proactive in their recruiting process. 

Over time, this will become a living recruiting database — continuously updated with verified 
staff contacts, school information, and a player’s personal outreach history.
