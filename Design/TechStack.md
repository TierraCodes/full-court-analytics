# Tech Stack
* Note: All technologies were preselected by our client
### NextJS (React)
* This site will require reusable components frequently throughout the website. React is well-suited for this and makes creating these components failry simple.
* https://react.dev
* https://nextjs.org

### Firebase (Db)
* Firebase Cloud Firestore will allow us to set up a simple NoSQL Db with minimal effort. It is not favored by our client but is required from previous project commitements.
* https://firebase.google.com

### GCP
* Full Court Analytics already used Google Cloud Platforms, so we will use it to fit in with their current system.

### TypeScript
* TypeScript is recommended by our client in tandum with React as it, being explicetly typed, forces us to write more maintainable code so we don't have to spend hours debuging JS. It is harder to write but easier to debug and maintain.

### Tailwind
* This styling framework allows us to standardize our pages styles with html classes instead of having local and global CSS files to manage. It is more customizable than other frameworks like Bootstrap, allowing a more personalized styling experience.

### Jotai (State Management)
* Jotai is still being debated whether or not it will be used by our client. If used, it will be utilzied towards the end of the project as React's built-in state management should suffice while our application is in early development. More complex applications benefit more from Jotai.
