# Business Requirements

### BR1 – Centralized Recruiting Research
    Athletes and their support network need a single, searchable, filterable recruiting database that eliminates the need for scattered spreadsheets, notes, and random online directories. This centralization saves time, improves accuracy, and allows players to make better-informed decisions about schools and staff. The ultimate business outcome is to streamline the recruiting process and keep athletes organized and proactive.

### BR2 – Relationship & Outreach Management
    Players need a system to track and manage outreach to schools and coaches, including logging calls/emails, setting reminders, and monitoring school interest. Without such a tool, athletes risk losing opportunities due to missed follow-ups or disorganized notes. The business outcome is improved communication consistency, stronger coach relationships, and a higher chance of successful recruiting placement.
