# Full Court Analytics

## Summary

This project adds a searchable, filterable database of college basketball program staff to the Full Court Analytics platform.
Players will be able to quickly search for a school, expand a dropdown to view coaches and staff, and click into a school profile for richer program details and contact information. The experience is designed for recruiting and relationship management — allowing users to favorite schools, log when they’ve reached out, and track a school’s level of interest.

The goal is to centralize recruiting research and outreach in one place so players don’t have to juggle spreadsheets, scattered notes, and random online directories. Accurate search, fast filtering (division, location, conference, etc.), and easy note-taking will help athletes stay organized and proactive in their recruiting process.

Over time, this will become a living recruiting database — continuously updated with verified staff contacts, school information, and a player’s personal outreach history
